# cognitive_synergy/requirements.txt
# Python package dependencies for the Cognitive Synergy Model project
# Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install
# --- Final Version (April 28, 2025) - Optimized for Google Colab Compatibility ---
# Changes made to resolve dependency conflicts observed in the Colab environment.

# Core ML Libraries
# Adjusted to use versions compatible with typical Colab pre-installed packages.
# Colab often has torch>=2.0. Check specific versions via !pip show torch torchvision if needed.
torch>=2.0.0              # Allows newer versions compatible with Colab defaults & torchvision
torchvision>=0.15.1          # Allows newer versions compatible with modern torch
# torchaudio>=0.10.0         # Uncomment if needed for audio tasks later (check compatibility)

# Model Backbones & Tokenizers
timm>=0.6.12,<0.7.0        # Kept specific range assuming project requires <0.7.0. Relax upper bound if not needed.
transformers>=4.20.0,<5.0.0 # Kept specific range assuming project requires <5.0.0. Relax upper bound if not needed.

# Configuration & Utilities
PyYAML>=6.0,<7.0            # For loading YAML configuration files
tqdm>=4.60.0,<5.0.0          # For progress bars
numpy>=2.0.0               # MODIFIED: Allows numpy 2.x, resolving conflict with Colab's 'thinc' package.
Pillow>=10.1               # MODIFIED: Allows Pillow >=10.1, resolving conflict with Colab's 'scikit-image'.

# Experiment Tracking (Optional)
# wandb>=0.12.0,<0.16.0     # Uncomment if using Weights & Biases - Check latest stable version

# Add other specific dependencies as needed for datasets, metrics, etc.
# Example:
# scikit-learn>=1.0 # For certain metrics or data processing
# pandas>=1.3 # For handling data manifests if not using simple JSON
# opencv-python-headless # If needed for specific image processing
