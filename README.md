# Cognitive Synergy Model - MVRP v1

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the "Cognitive Synergy Model", a multimodal architecture designed to integrate Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities in a novel way. Inspired by principles of human cognition, the model aims for deeper fusion and interaction between modalities compared to standard approaches.

The core ideas include:
* **Multi-Level Bi-Directional Interfaces:** Connecting corresponding intermediate layers of the ViT and LLM to allow mutual influence during processing.
* **Shared Workspace:** A dedicated module (using Transformer layers) to fuse contributions from different interface levels into a unified `world_state` representation.
* **Modular Design:** Components like backbones, interfaces, workspace, and prediction heads are separated for clarity and extensibility.
* **Configuration Driven:** Experiments are managed via YAML configuration files.

This initial version (MVRP v1) focuses on establishing the core architecture and includes functionality for training using a **Contrastive Alignment** objective (similar to CLIP/ALIGN).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace with your repository URL
    cd cognitive_synergy_project_root # Navigate to the top-level directory
    ```

2.  **Create Environment (Recommended):**
    Using Conda:
    ```bash
    conda create -n cognitive_synergy python=3.9 # Or desired Python version (e.g., 3.10)
    conda activate cognitive_synergy
    ```
    Or using venv:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install PyTorch according to your system/CUDA version from the official website: [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)
    Then, install other required packages from the `requirements.txt` file (ensure it's at the project root):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

Training and evaluation are controlled via YAML configuration files located in the `configs/` directory.

* `configs/base_config.yaml`: Contains default settings for the model architecture, training parameters, data paths, etc. Review and adjust defaults as needed.
* Experiment-specific files (e.g., `configs/experiment_mvrp_v1.yaml`) can be created to override specific settings from the base config for different runs.

**Important:** You **must** update the data paths (`train_manifest`, `val_manifest`, `image_root`) in your configuration file (`base_config.yaml` or an experiment-specific override) to point to your actual dataset locations. If using Weights & Biases logging (`use_wandb: true`), ensure you set your `wandb_entity`.

## Usage

*(Assuming you are running commands from the project root directory where `scripts/` and `configs/` reside)*

### Training

Run the main training script, providing the path to your configuration file:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/your_experiment_config.yaml
Replace your_experiment_config.yaml with the desired configuration file (you can start by copying and modifying base_config.yaml).Checkpoints will be saved in the directory specified by checkpointing.checkpoint_dir in the config (default: ./checkpoints).Logs (console, file, WandB) will be configured based on the logging section of the config.To resume training from a checkpoint, set the resume_from_checkpoint path in the checkpointing section of your config file (can be a specific path or 'latest'), or use the --resume command-line argument in train.py.EvaluationRun the evaluation script, providing the configuration file used during training and the path to the specific checkpoint you want to evaluate:python scripts/evaluate.py \
    --config path/to/training/effective_config.yaml \
    --checkpoint path/to/your/checkpoint.pth.tar \
    --eval_manifest path/to/your/eval_manifest.json
Use the configuration file that was used for the training run associated with the checkpoint (often saved alongside checkpoints, e.g., effective_config.yaml).Provide the path to the specific model checkpoint (.pth.tar file).Provide the path to the manifest file for the evaluation dataset.Evaluation results (loss, metrics) will be printed and potentially saved to a file in the checkpoint directory.Next Steps & Future WorkThis MVRP v1 provides the foundation. Future development could include:Implementing and training with downstream task heads (VQA, ITM, Captioning).Refining the interface and workspace modules based on experimental results (e.g., tuning attention heads, enabling FiLM, exploring different pooling).Implementing more sophisticated curriculum learning strategies.Integrating advanced logging and experiment tracking features more deeply.Adapting the Trainer for distributed training (DDP/FSDP) and mixed precision (AMP).Adding more comprehensive evaluation metrics specific to tasks.Exploring different backbone models (e.g., different ViT sizes, other LLMs like T5, Llama).Adding unit tests and integration tests for better
